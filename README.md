# My Mission



I absolutely adore programming, electronics, and robotics! There's something truly magical about being able to create and control machines, and I find it incredibly fulfilling to work with technology in this way. Whether I'm coding a new application or building a circuit,<br> I'm always eager to dive in and explore the possibilities. For me, there's nothing quite like the feeling of seeing my ideas come to life through programming and technology.

# Components Needed:


|        Component   Name       |Price                          |Purpose               |
|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|Arduino Uno (MicroController)|  9.99$ - 20.00$  |Is the brain of the Operation|
|L293D Motor Driver Module    | 13.00$           |its the main driver and power for the motors|
|battery Holder 4 cover slots |7.99$			       |to power Up the l293D and power up the Motor Wheels|
|ESP8266 Serial Wifi Module ESP-01 3.3V          |11.99$	| Wifi Module to control the car via Wifi|
|BreadBoard                   |7.77$	           |	Connect All the circuits to the components |


# How to use a L293D Motor Driver Shield

1. Connect the motor driver shield to your Arduino or compatible board. Make sure that the pins on the shield are properly aligned with the headers on the board.
2. Connect the power supply to the motor driver shield. The L293D can handle up to 36V DC, but the voltage level should match the specifications of your motor.
3. Connect your motors to the motor driver shield. The L293D has two channels, so you can connect up to two motors. Make sure that you connect the positive and negative terminals correctly.
